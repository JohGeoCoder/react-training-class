1.Create a new component named CarTool.

2. In the CarTool component, display a header using a header tag and h1 tag which displays "Car Tool".

3. Import CarTool into index.js, and display the CarTool component under the HelloWorld.

4. Run the app to ensure it works.

The definition of "works" is not what you see in the browser, it's the DOM structure produced by React.
